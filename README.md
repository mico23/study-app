# Study Effort Tracker

## Overview
This application is to measure the user's effort to course(s) the user study. It records the hours a user plans to
spend on courses and the outcome of the study. The main target users are students, but it is useful for anyone who is
learning new skills. Time management is the key to survive on handling multiple courses. Sometimes students may
allocate their time inefficiently, which causes them to underperform. If the user spends too much time on a course,
but the outcome is under the average performance, this can be a good indicator that the user may improve their study
strategy or reallocate their time.

The application has the following features:
- add courses to a list
- entre hours to the course on the list
- entre outcome (e.g. *grades*)  to the course on the list
- calculate the average of the outcomes among all courses
